	<p>
		I'm a <strong>Front-End Developer at Dycoders</strong> with over 2 years of experience in building responsive, high-performance web applications.
		My core tech stack includes ReactJS, VueJS, Next.js, Vite, Astro.js, live_view, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.
		I have hands-on experience with Redux Toolkit, Pinia, i18next, and PrimeVue.
	</p>

	<p>
		I specialize in developing scalable, user-centric UI/UX solutions and clean, maintainable code.
		I've worked on various projects—from SaaS platforms to AI chatbots—both solo and within agile teams.
	</p>

	<p>
		Currently, I'm diving deeper into the backend using Node.js and Firebase, with a strong focus on AI integration.
		I'm actively exploring OpenAI SDKs, LLMs, RAG pipelines, and Computer Vision to build smart, real-world applications.
	</p>

	<p>
		My goal is to become a <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong> who builds AI-driven, innovative software solutions.
		I'm driven by curiosity, continuous learning, and creating meaningful products that solve real problems.
